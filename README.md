## Honda Push Button Shifter
This code was written for a prototype push button shifter with the goal of showing it to Honda to spark interest in GHSP's ability to manufacture high quality products at a low cost.

The code is quite limited in terms of functionality and mainly changes LEDs based on the button input. The button inputs used redundant contacts with two digital and one analog contact. 

The contact monitroing project was also used to verify the part would last through its durability and environmental cycling.

During durability testing, the contact monitoring project helped discover a tolerance issue with the design of the buttons. Further analysis was performed and the tolerance issue was fixed.
